# IPFS Ubuntu Docker Image
A docker image for ipfs with ubuntu as base image.
Compared with the official [ipfs docker image](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) this is not a light-weight image but for some use cases it is useful to have a full ubuntu.

To build this image run the following command in the folder of this repository:
```
docker build -t arneboockmeyer/ipfs:latest .
```
